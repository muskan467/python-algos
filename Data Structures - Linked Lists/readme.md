## Introduction
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one, forming a chain-like structure. Linked lists are often used to implement dynamic data structures and are commonly used in various programming languages, including Python.

## Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a type of linked list where each element, called a node, has a reference to the next node in the sequence. Here are some common operations and topics related to singly linked lists:

### Deletion of Singly Linked List
Deletion in a singly linked list involves removing a specific node from the list. It can be done by updating the references of the previous node to skip the node to be deleted. Various scenarios and techniques can be applied to perform deletion operations efficiently.

### Insertion in Singly Linked List
Insertion in a singly linked list involves adding a new node to the list. It can be done at the beginning, end, or at a specific position within the list. Proper insertion techniques are essential to maintain the integrity of the linked list.

## Circular Linked List
A circular linked list is a variant of a singly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a closed loop. Circular linked lists are useful in applications where a continuous loop is required.

## Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes. This bidirectional linkage makes it easier to traverse the list in both directions, but it requires more memory compared to singly linked lists.
